# Chapter 2
- While loops (as in Java)
    - increment is done with the operator first (++i)
- boolean in Java = bool in C++
- Strings have a specific type for size: std::string::size_type (unsigned)
- ints are at least 32767 and signed
- if statements, || and &&, == order of operations are the same
- Repeated std:: is annoying, use `using std::cout;` to use cout
- for loops are similar, except preincrement is the style
- Types
    - bool: true or false
    - unsigned: int with only non negatives
    - short: int with at least 16 bits
    - long: int with at least 32 bits
    - size_t: unsigned type that holds any object's size
    - string::size_type: unsigned string size
- Using directives
    - using namespace-name::name; namespace-name::name == name
