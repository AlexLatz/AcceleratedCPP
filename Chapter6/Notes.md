# Chapter 6

- Many container operations work regardless of type
  - The string class also supports some (bc its somewhat of a list)
- Copying elements from container to container
  - copy(iterator begin, iterator end, iterator\_adaptor insertfrom)
  - copies elements between two iterators and inserts starting at insertfrom
  - Iterator adaptors are functions that yield iterators with special properties
    - The most common is back\_inserter(ret), which appends elements to ret
- find\_if(iterator begin, iterator end, boolfxn condition)
  - returns an iterator of the first occurance where the condition is true
- find\_if doesn't work well with overloaded fxns, so a wrapper may be necessary
- string constructor (iterator begin, iterator end) makes string from iterators
- equals(iterator begin, iterator end, iterator reverseother)
  - returns a bool if the range [begin, end) is equal to reverse + end elements
- find(iterator begin, iterator end, element e) - finds occurance of e
- static elements - a storage class specifier
  - static elements are preserved across function calls, only initialized once
- transform(iterator begin, iterator end, iterator\_adaptor insertfrom, fxn apply)
  - Applies the function to each element and then attaches to insertfrom
  - This doesn't work with overloaded functions, bc the compiler can't tell which
  - They also can't handle exceptions in the function, so must be caught somewhere
- function parameters - can pass a parameter that specifies a function
  - ex. `void test(int function(int a));` takes in a int function that needs an int
- \<numeric\> header - tools for numeric computations
  - accumulate(iter begin, iter end, number sumstart)
  - Adds all elements between to the sum (takes type of sumstart)
- Algorithms act on container elements - NOT containers
  - ex. remove will not remove elements from the container, instead copying to front
  - You can then remove them with an erase call
