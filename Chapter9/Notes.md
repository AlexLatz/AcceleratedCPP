# Chapter 9

- Defining custom types - the cornerstone of OOP
  - You can add functions to a struct
  - ex. `type name(type param);` in the list of instance variables
  - Accessed through name.fxn() like in Java
  - Later defined in a source file fully - name is Class::fxn when defining
  - When writing this function, assume the scope is inside of the struct
  - To make a function const, add it after the parameter list
- Can access a nameless scope with ::function()
