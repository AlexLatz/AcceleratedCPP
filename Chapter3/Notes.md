# Chapter 3

- cin can be applied to multiple variables ex. `cin >> name >> name2;`
    - Can use a loop as cin returns a boolean value on success or incorrect typing
    - Can also use `if (cin)` to check the success of the last operation
    - cin returns false when reaching the end-of-line (Ctrl-Z windows, Ctrl-D others)
- Local variables not initialized are "undefined" (c++ normally doesn't check for this)
    - Can lead to errors if the undefined variable isn't overwritten before use
- type streamsize returned by cout.precision(), indicates number of decimal places
    - Can set the precision by `cout << setprecision(int places);`
- vector<> is the equivalent of a List<> in Java
    - ex. `vector<int>` because primitives can be used
    - vector.push_back() pushes a value to the back of the vector
    - vector<int>::size_type = size type for int vector
    - Can redefine it with `typedef vector<int>::size_type vec_sz`
    - vector.size() returns the size as a size_type
    - Can index into the vector with normal bracket syntax
    - They don't check for out of range indices, which can lead to errors
- <algorithm> header contains useful algorithms like sort(vectorelement beg, vectorelement end)
    - sort rearranges the vector to increasing in place across the two positions
    - Can get beginning and end with vector.begin() and vector.end()
